# Task ID: 10
# Title: Google Ads API Integration for Campaign Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate Google Ads API to retrieve campaign KPIs and ROI metrics.
# Details:
- Use google-ads-api v17 SDK or REST; requires developer token, OAuth, customer ID with read perms.
- Query via GAQL for campaigns: clicks, impressions, cost_micros, conversions, conversion_rate, date.
- Persist in gads_campaign_stats; compute ROI if revenue available (else show CPA).
- Handle paging and partial failures; respect per-customer rate limits.
- UI: campaign table with sorting, cost and conversion trends, budget utilization gauge.
- Secure refresh tokens; rotate credentials; store only on server.
- Implement incremental sync by date; backfill last 90 days.

# Test Strategy:
- Validate sample queries in the Ads UI vs API.
- Unit test GAQL builders and error handling.
- Simulate quota errors and ensure retries/backoff.
