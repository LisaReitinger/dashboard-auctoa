# Task ID: 13
# Title: n8n Workflow Automation for Data Collection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure n8n workflows to orchestrate pulls from sources and push to API webhooks.
# Details:
- Deploy n8n (cloud or self-host). Create credentials for Google APIs, Ads, chatbot, and News.
- Workflows:
  - Scheduled daily GSC/GA4 pulls -> transform -> POST to /api/{gsc,ga4} bulk endpoints.
  - Chatbot webhook receiver -> sanitize PII -> POST to /api/chatbot.
  - Ads sync every 4 hours.
  - Alerts RSS poll every 6 hours.
- Include retry nodes, error branches to send notifications (email/Slack) and write to system_health.
- Secure n8n to API via HMAC signature header checked in API routes.
- Document workflows and environment variables.

# Test Strategy:
- Run workflows in test mode; verify API receives signed payloads.
- Force errors to ensure retries and error notifications function.
- Confirm dedupe logic prevents duplicates on replays.
