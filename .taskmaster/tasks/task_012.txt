# Task ID: 12
# Title: Real-time Updates, Live Activity Feed, and Data Freshness Indicators
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable live synchronization and visibility into recent actions and system status.
# Details:
- Use Supabase Realtime channels on activity_feed and system_health tables to push updates to clients.
- Log significant events: sync start/finish, errors, user actions (exports, filters saved).
- Display a Live Activity Feed component subscribing via supabase.channel('activity').
- Data freshness badges per section: compute last_sync from system_health; color-code.
- For real-time ingestion, integrate n8n workflows to POST to /api hooks which write and emit activity events.

# Test Strategy:
- Simulate insert into activity_feed and verify UI updates without refresh.
- Unit test freshness calculation.
- Chaos test: send burst of events and ensure UI throttles rendering.
