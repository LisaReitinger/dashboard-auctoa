# Task ID: 2
# Title: Design System Setup: Theme, Typography, Colors, WCAG Baseline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish a cohesive design system with Tailwind tokens, shadcn theme, and accessibility foundations, emphasizing modern, clean, and visually appealing design as the top priority.
# Details:
CRITICAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Modern, clean interface with plenty of white space
- Professional color scheme and typography
- Enterprise-grade visual aesthetics
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Intuitive information hierarchy
- Mobile-responsive design patterns
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG)

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Use Tailwind CSS variables for color tokens (primary, secondary, accent, success, warning, danger, muted, background, foreground) with HSL.
- Generate light/dark palettes; ensure contrast ratios â‰¥ 4.5:1 for body text while maintaining visual appeal.
- Configure shadcn theme with CSS variables; include focus states and motion-safe animations that enhance user experience.
- Set base typography scale, spacing, radii; import Inter or Geist via next/font for professional typography.
- Establish comprehensive spacing scales that promote ample white space and clean layouts.
- Create design tokens for elevation (shadows), borders, and transitions that reinforce the modern aesthetic.
- Create reusable UI patterns with emphasis on visual polish: KPI Card, Section Header, Stat Delta (trend up/down with colors), Empty State, Skeleton Loader.
- Implement subtle micro-interactions and transitions to enhance perceived quality.
- Document components in a Storybook 8 setup for visual regression (optional but recommended for internal).
- Add aria attributes and keyboard navigation patterns to nav components.
- Design component variants that maintain visual consistency while offering flexibility.

# Test Strategy:
- Use axe-core/Playwright to check for zero critical accessibility violations.
- Manually test keyboard navigation and focus order.
- Visual regression snapshots of components in Storybook.
- Conduct design reviews focused on visual appeal, white space usage, and professional appearance.
- Test animations and transitions for smoothness across devices.
- Verify information hierarchy through user testing or expert review.
- Ensure responsive design patterns maintain visual integrity across breakpoints.
