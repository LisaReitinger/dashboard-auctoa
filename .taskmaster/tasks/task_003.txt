# Task ID: 3
# Title: Core Layout, Routing, and Navigation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement visually stunning, responsive layout with sidebar, header, breadcrumbs, and section routes using App Router, emphasizing clean design principles and professional visual hierarchy.
# Details:
- App Router structure: app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx with Sidebar, Header, Breadcrumbs; pages: /, /search-performance, /website-analytics, /chatbot-analytics, /campaign-performance, /settings.
- Design Focus: Clean, modern layout with abundant white space; professional enterprise-grade visual hierarchy; intuitive information architecture.
- Sidebar: collapsible, icons via lucide-react; active route highlighting; mobile Sheet for small screens; elegant design with smooth transition animations.
- Header: polished user menu, search input (debounced), notifications dropdown; consistent visual styling.
- Breadcrumbs: derive from segment; add aria-label; integrate seamlessly with overall design.
- Responsive grid system using Tailwind (grid-cols-12) and container queries with mobile-first approach.
- Animations: Implement smooth navigation transitions between routes; subtle hover effects; loading state animations.
- Visual Consistency: Maintain consistent spacing, typography, and color usage across all sections.
- Error boundary and loading.tsx for each route with visually appealing states.
- Add NotFound and global toasts with design-consistent styling.

# Test Strategy:
- Lighthouse check for responsive behavior and visual performance.
- Verify routing works and loading/error states render per route with smooth transitions.
- Keyboard navigation across sidebar/header with screen reader labels.
- Test visual consistency across different viewport sizes.
- Validate animation performance on lower-end devices.
- Ensure design maintains integrity across all major breakpoints.
